# 3D-Printed-Wall-e

--**This page is still in development**--

**THE** page for the Wall-e project! I made it because our group will not be in ACT for all eternity, and it is nice to collaborate.
Below, I will go into as much detail as possible to help whoever might be interested in continuing work in the future, and if you are reading this, that is likely you, so... thank you!
This is essentially the first thing I am doing with GitHub, so pardon the occasional (or constant) sloppiness.

## Operation

Tap your phone on the NFC leaf and go to the website that controls the (not so) lil dud. Scan the QR code on the inside to get to this page (but that's most likely what you already did) and start digging around.

## Programing

Latest [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)

## List of Parts

A lot of these parts are what we had available in the lab, they may not be the highest performing and most capable of implementing new fancy features, but here's to hoping they will hold up and that tougher tasks can be offloaded.

### Paint

## Potential upgrades

A new battery... PLEASE! The one we have is a _CHUNKY_ **HEAVY** boi, and it is only 3000mAh, and is (~undisclosed~) old
