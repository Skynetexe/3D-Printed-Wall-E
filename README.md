# 3D-Printed-Wall-e
**THE** page for the Wall-e project! I made it because our group will not be in ACT for all eternity, and it is nice to collaborate.
Below, I will go into as much detail as possible to help whoever might be interested in continuing work in the future, and if you are reading this, that is likely you, so... thank you :)!
This is essentially the first thing I am doing with GitHub, so pardon the occasional (or constant) sloppiness.

# List of Parts
A lot of these parts are what we had available in the lab, they may not be the highest performing and most capable for implementing new fancy things, but heres to hoping they will hold up and that tougher tasks can be offloaded.

Electronics:
- Raspberry Pi (the better, the better. [What we have](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-2-model-b/).)
- Arduino Uno
- 12V DC Geared Motor x 2
- Motor shield
- 9g Servo motor x 9
- Servo controller
- 5v buck converter (12v to 5v down-stepper)

Misc:
- M3 Nuts x 12/20 (will check later)
- M3 Screws (20mm,10mm) x ~12 each (will check later)
- M2 20mm screw x 1
- Paperclips
