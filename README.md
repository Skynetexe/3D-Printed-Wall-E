# 3D-Printed-Wall-e
**THE** page for the Wall-e project! I made it because I will not be in the school for all eternity and it is nice to collaborate
Below, I will go into as much detail as possible to help whoever might be interested in continuing work in the future, and if you are reading this, that is likely you, so... thank you :)!
This is essentially the first thing I am doing with GitHub, so pardon the occasional (or constant) sloppiness.
