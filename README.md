# 3D-Printed-Wall-e

--**This page is still in development**--

**THE** page for the Wall-e project! I made it because our group will not be in ACT for all eternity, and it is nice to collaborate.
Below, I will go into as much detail as possible to help whoever might be interested in continuing work in the future, and if you are reading this, that is likely you, so... thank you!
This is essentially the first thing I am doing with GitHub, so pardon the occasional (or constant) sloppiness.

## Operation

Tap your phone on the NFC leaf and go to the website that controls the (not so) lil dud. Scan the QR code on the inside to get to this page (but that's most likely what you already did) and start digging around.

## Programing

Latest [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software "arduino.cc/software")

## List of Parts

Listed bellow are electronics metal parts and paints. I will detail them as much as possible and add links to where they can be bought or whatever other website might be more relevant. **Hovering** over the link will show you the **exact model** of the item so that you can do your own searching.

> _Copying the models could prove difficult. I would recommend using OCR software or going to the README.md file and finding them in "quotation marks" after the links_.

A lot of these parts are what we had available in the lab, they may not be the highest performing and most capable of implementing new fancy features, but here's to hoping they will hold up and that tougher tasks can be offloaded.

If for whatever reason the links no longer work or you find websites which are better suited please open an issue report so that I can update them.
